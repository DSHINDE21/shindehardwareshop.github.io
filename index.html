        <h1>About Hardware</h1>
        <p>On 15th September 1965, Haji M Ibrahim, hand in hand with his brother Haji M Mohammed Kunju and brother in law Marhoom T H Ebrahim Kareem, gave definite shape to a venture called INDIAN HARDWARE STORES at Broadway, Ernakulam, that marked a milestone in the history of building material market in Kerala. Then, nobody knew that this was a venture destined to change the pace of Buildersware Industry in Kerala market.

            Indian hardware Stores continued it's journey from success to victory. Gradually most of the builders and contractors started to rely on Indian Hardware Stores for their materials, as a dependable supplier. Apart from private sector, Government and Semi government organizations too were brought to their fold soon. Their main clientele included KSEB, FACT, TCC, TCM, IRE, KEL, etc . During the development of the Mattuppetty Dam, majority of the materials were supplied by Indian Hardware Stores.
            
            During April 1992, Indian Hardware stores was shifted to a new spacious showroom at T D Road, Ernakulam. It was then that they started door delivery services which helped them to spread their reach to remote corners of Kerala and thereby cater to the needs of retailers in such remote areas.
            
            To beat the recession, new products and new customers were essential and it was this that lead Indian Hardware Stores into the concept of Visual Merchandising. They stepped into the field of display racks and soon they could capture lion's share of the market of these products too.
            
            As a part of their expansion, Indian Hardware Stores started a retail showroom at N H Byepass, Bhavaraparambu Junction, Chakkaraparambu. This well furnished showroom with attractive display of their range of products is yet another feather in their cap.</p>
